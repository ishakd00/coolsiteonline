    <p>Toy raycasting engine in SFML</p>
    <p>was fun</p>
    <!-- <p>Wanted to do some graphics in c++ and the simplest thing I could do was a raycasting engine.</p>
    <p>I followed this tutorial: <a href="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html">https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html</a> </p>
    <p>But some parts were too clever for me so I did things the dumb way. </p>
    <p>Think it works pretty well. The textures are all stolen, sue me.</p>
    <p>Also check this meme out: <img style="height: auto; width: 200px;" src="https://www.code-inspector.com/project/22680/score/svg" alt="Img couldn't load :(" srcset=""></p>
    <p>Like any good wagecuck i put everything I code proudly on my github, no matter how shitty it is: </p>
